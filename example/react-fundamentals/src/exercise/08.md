# Controlled Forms

## Background

Sometimes you have form inputs which you want to programmatically control. Maybe
you want to set their value explicitly when the user clicks a button, or maybe
you want to change what the value is as the user is typing.

This is why React supports Controlled Form inputs. So far in our exercises, all
of the forms inputs have been completely "uncontrolled" which means that the
browser is maintaining the state of the input by itself and we can be notified
of changes and "query" for the value from the DOM node.

If we want to explicitly update that value we could do this:
`inputNode.value = 'whatever'` but that's pretty imperative. Instead, React
allows us to set a `value` prop on the input like so:

```jsx
<input value={myInputValue} />
```

Once we do that, React ensures that the value of that input can never change
from the value of the `myInputValue` variable.

Typically you'll want to provide an `onChange` handler as well so you can be
made aware of "suggested changes" to the input's value (where React is basically
saying "if I were controlling this value, here's what I would do, but you do
whatever you want with this").

Typically you'll want to store the input's value in a state variable (via
`React.useState`) and then the `onChange` handler will call the state updater to
keep that value up-to-date.

## Exercise

Wouldn't it be even cooler if instead of showing an error message we just didn't
allow the user to enter invalid input? Yeah! In this exercise I've backed us up
and removed the error stuff and now we're going to control the input state and
control the input value. Any time there's a change we'll call `.toLowerCase()`
on the value to ensure that it's always the lower case version of what the user
types.
