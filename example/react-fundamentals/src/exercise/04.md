# Creating custom components

## Background

Just like in regular JavaScript, you often want to share code which you do using
functions. If you want to share JSX, you can do that as well. In React we call
these functions "components" and they have some special properties.

Components are basically functions which return something that is "renderable"
(more React elements, strings, `null`, numbers, etc.)

## Exercise

Let's say the DOM we want to generate is like this:

```html
<div className="container">
  <div className="message">Hello World</div>
  <div className="message">Goodbye World</div>
</div>
```

In this case, it would be cool if we could reduce the duplication for creating
the React elements for this:

```jsx
<div className="message">{children}</div>
```

So we need to make a function which accepts the children.

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ using a custom component with React.createElement

So far we've only used `React.createElement(someString)`, but the first argument
to `React.createElement` can also be a function which returns something that's
renderable.

So instead of calling your `message` function, pass it as the first argument to
`React.createElement` and pass the `{children: 'Hello World'}` object as the
second argument.

### ðŸ’¯ using a custom component with JSX

We're so close! Just like using JSX for regular `div`s is nicer than using the
raw `React.createElement` API, using JSX for custom components is nicer too.
Remember that it's Babel that's responsible for taking our JSX and compiling it
to `React.createElement` calls so we just need a way to tell Babel how to
compile our JSX so it passes the function by its name rather than a string.

We do this by how the JSX appears. Here are a few examples of Babel output for
JSX:

```javascript
ui = <Captialized /> // React.createElement(Captialized)
ui = <property.access /> // React.createElement(property.access)
ui = <Property.Access /> // React.createElement(Property.Access)
ui = <Property['Access'] /> // SyntaxError
ui = <lowercase /> // React.createElement('lowercase')
ui = <kebab-case /> // React.createElement('kebab-case')
ui = <Upper-Kebab-Case /> // React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')
ui = <Upper_Snake_Case /> // React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)
ui = <lower_snake_case /> // React.createElement('lower_snake_case')
```

See if you can change your component so people can use it with JSX more easily!
